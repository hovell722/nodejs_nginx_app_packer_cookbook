## ERB and ice cream cones <% %> and <%= %>

ERB is embedded ruby.

Meaning you can interpolate variables or run ruby code.

It can then be converted to a string.

ERB is like the f'this is python {hello} ' but for entire documents!

#### <% %> allow ruby with no output

#### <%= %> allows ruby with output (I mean like printing to the documents)
